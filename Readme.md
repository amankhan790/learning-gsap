Description:
🚀 A curated collection of projects and experiments built while learning GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). This repository showcases my ability to create smooth, performant, and interactive web animations using modern JavaScript techniques.

✨ Highlights:

● Hands-on animation demos (scroll effects, timelines, transitions).

● Clean, reusable, and well-structured code for real-world use.

● Focus on enhancing user experience and visual storytelling.

📌 Goal: To demonstrate my frontend development skills in animation and interactivity, while continuously improving my expertise with GSAP and modern web technologies.
